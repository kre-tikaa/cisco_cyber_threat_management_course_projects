# Module 3: Threat Intelligence

This folder contains completed lab assignments for **Module 3: Threat Intelligence** from the Cisco Cyber Threat Management course. These labs explore how to evaluate cybersecurity reports, research vulnerabilities (CVEs), and investigate potential malware using threat intelligence platforms.

---

## ✅ Labs Included

### 🔹 Lab 1: Evaluate Cybersecurity Reports
- Researched findings from the 2020 Webroot Threat Report
- Studied industry-specific threat intelligence from FIREEYE for Healthcare and Energy sectors
- Analyzed real-time cybersecurity updates from CISA, including:
  - Nation-state threats (e.g., China’s Volt Typhoon)
  - CVEs in software like Wing FTP Server and Citrix NetScaler
- Reflected on trends in phishing, ransomware, and fileless malware
- Compared multiple cybersecurity reports across years

### 🔹 Lab 2: Identify Relevant Threat Intelligence
- Researched MITRE’s CVE and ATT&CK frameworks
- Investigated CVEs from Cisco Security Advisories
- Explored techniques under ATT&CK tactics like:
  - Reconnaissance (e.g., Phishing for Information)
  - Command and Control (e.g., Data Encoding)
  - Impact (e.g., Disk Wipe)
- Analyzed a suspicious file using SHA256 on:
  - Cisco Talos Intelligence Center
  - VirusTotal
- Identified file reputation, malware aliases, and creation timestamp
