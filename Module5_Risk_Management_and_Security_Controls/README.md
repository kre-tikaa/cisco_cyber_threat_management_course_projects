## ‚úÖ Labs Included

### üîπ Lab 1: Risk Management
- Learned and applied risk action types: **Avoidance**, **Mitigation**, **Transfer**, **Acceptance**
- Explored risk concepts: threats, vulnerabilities, impact, and countermeasures
- Analyzed a case study involving a customer database and identified associated risks
- Prioritized threats and proposed actionable mitigation strategies
- Compared and explained key terms: **Due Care** vs **Due Diligence**

### üîπ Lab 2: Risk Analysis
- Applied both **Quantitative** and **Qualitative** risk analysis methods
- Calculated:
  - **Asset Value**
  - **Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)**
  - **Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)**
  - **Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)**
- Completed case study challenges including risk scoring for laptops, servers, storage systems, and cloud environments
- Built qualitative risk impact matrix using impact vs likelihood assessment

### üîπ Lab 3: Security Controls Implementation
- Analyzed a real-world scenario involving Greenville Public School‚Äôs weak security posture
- Proposed comprehensive security controls across three control types:
  - **Physical** (e.g., locks, alarms, CCTV)
  - **Technical** (e.g., firewalls, encryption, anti-malware)
  - **Administrative** (e.g., security training, role-based access)
- Categorized each control into **Preventive**, **Detective**, and **Corrective** functions
- Addressed issues like student data tampering, weak credentials, ransomware, and unauthorized access
