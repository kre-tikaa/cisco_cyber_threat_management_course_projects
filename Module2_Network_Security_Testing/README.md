# 🛡️ Cisco Module 2: Network Security Testing – Lab Projects

This folder contains completed lab assignments for **Module 2: Network Security Testing** from the Cisco Cyber Threat Management course. These labs focus on using tools like Packet Tracer and Wireshark to analyze network configurations and encrypted/unencrypted traffic.

---

## ✅ Labs Overview

### 🔹 Lab 1: Use Diagnostic Commands (Packet Tracer)
- Used `ipconfig`, `ping`, `tracert`, `nslookup`, and `netstat` commands
- Diagnosed device settings and IP configurations
- Troubleshot DNS resolution and FTP connectivity
- Investigated ARP table behavior across VLANs
- Identified and resolved packet flow and service port issues

### 🔹 Lab 2: Compare Telnet and SSH Traffic (Wireshark)
- Captured Telnet and SSH traffic using Wireshark in VM
- Demonstrated that Telnet traffic is **unencrypted and visible**
- Showed how SSH traffic is **encrypted and secure**
- Used packet filters and detailed protocol views in Wireshark
- Understood the difference in security between Telnet and SSH

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Wireshark Protocol Analyzer
- Linux Terminal (Ubuntu via CSE-LABVM)
- Diagnostic Commands: `ping`, `tracert`, `arp -a`, `netstat`, `ftp`, `ipconfig`, `nslookup`, `telnet`, `ssh`
